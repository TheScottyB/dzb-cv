# Project History, Roadmap, and Audit

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the modernization, roadmap, and audit history for the DZB-CV monorepo. It is intended to help contributors and maintainers understand the evolution, current state, and future direction of the project.

## Modernization Summary

### Overview
The modernization effort aimed to:
- Improve developer experience and code quality
- Enhance build performance and reliability
- Implement strict type safety across the codebase
- Optimize bundle size and runtime performance
- Set up proper testing infrastructure
- Standardize component development patterns

### Completed Tasks
- Updated TypeScript to ES2022, enabled strict type checking
- Fixed all TypeScript errors and improved type definitions
- Converted UI components to TypeScript with CSS modules
- Implemented proper exports, tree-shaking, and module resolution
- Enhanced Turbo build system and caching
- Configured package exports and sideEffects for tree shaking
- Implemented Changesets for version management
- Added Playwright for E2E testing and robust test utilities
- Unified VSCode settings and documentation

### Current State (as of 2025-06)
- Unified TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configs at the root
- All packages use a shared `test-utils.ts` for DRY sample data, factories, and helpers
- ESM-compatible mocking with `vi.mock` and `importActual` is standard for robust, future-proof tests
- All test suites are DRY, maintainable, and pass with high coverage
- Modern build, lint, and test pipeline with CI/CD integration
- Path aliases and extensionless imports for modern TypeScript

### Lessons Learned
- Centralizing configuration and utilities reduces maintenance overhead
- ESM mocking is essential for future-proof, reliable tests
- DRY test data and helpers improve test quality and speed up development
- Consistent documentation and audit practices help maintain project health

## Roadmap

> **Note (2025-06):** Unified test-utils and ESM mocking are now standard across all packages. Robust, DRY test suites are in place, and phases 2, 4, and 5 are complete.

### Phases

- **Phase 0 – Project Setup & Governance**: Initial roadmap, CODEOWNERS, commit-lint (complete)
- **Phase 1 – Repository Audit**: Inventory, coverage, duplicate code, CLI matrix (complete)
- **Phase 2 – Testing Coverage & Quality**: Vitest config, unit/integration tests, coverage badge, CI gate (**Completed**)
- **Phase 3 – Documentation**: Architecture, API docs, agent system guide (in progress)
- **Phase 4 – Code Organization & Refactor**: Types consolidation, PDF service unification, tool consolidation (**Completed**)
- **Phase 5 – Build, Release & CI/CD**: tsup, semantic-release, changelog, CI pipeline (**Completed**)
- **Phase 6 – Standardised Error Handling**: AppError, typed errors, CLI handler (planned)
- **Phase 7 – Dependency Consolidation & Security**: Library consolidation, audit, dependabot (planned)
- **Phase 8 – Agent System Completion**: Agent interfaces, coordinator, memory, tests, docs (planned)
- **Phase 9 – Modernization & Containerization**: Node 20, Docker, multi-arch, container registry (planned)

See the full roadmap for details on each phase and deliverables.

## Recent Audit Highlights (2025-04-26)

### Overview
The latest audit analyzed repository structure, test coverage, documentation, and dependencies. Key findings:

- **Test Coverage**: No coverage report found (run `pnpm test:coverage` to generate)
- **Documentation**: No empty documentation files found
- **Duplicate/Unused Code**: Several duplicate type definitions and potentially unused files identified
- **Dependencies**: Multiple PDF and Markdown libraries; consider consolidation
- **CLI Commands**: All major commands present and inventoried

### Recommendations
1. Increase test coverage, especially for core services
2. Fill in any missing documentation, especially architecture docs
3. Address duplicate type definitions between core and shared modules
4. Consolidate duplicate libraries to reduce bundle size
5. Continue modernizing the build system and CI pipeline
