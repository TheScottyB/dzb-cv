    <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
    <p>
      I am writing to express my strong interest in the part-time Medical Laboratory
      Scientist/Medical Laboratory Technician position at Mercyhealth Hospital and Medical
      Center-Harvard. As a Harvard resident with extensive experience in healthcare operations and
      laboratory support, I am particularly interested in the day shift schedule (40 hours/2 weeks)
      that would allow me to contribute to my local community’s healthcare system while pursuing my
      educational goals in medical laboratory science.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my current role as Front Desk/Veterinary Assistant at Fox Lake Animal Hospital, I manage
      complex medical documentation and laboratory coordination while handling 60-80 daily patient
      interactions. This experience has honed my attention to detail, accuracy in record-keeping,
      and ability to maintain high standards in a fast-paced medical environment - skills that are
      directly applicable to clinical laboratory procedures in hematology, urinalysis, chemistry,
      and blood bank testing.
    </p>
    <p>My career has been built on a foundation of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring precise documentation and record-keeping in medical settings</li>
      <li>Coordinating with laboratory and pharmacy operations</li>
      <li>Maintaining strict compliance with medical regulations and procedures</li>
      <li>Managing medical equipment preparation and sterilization</li>
      <li>Implementing efficient processes for high-volume operations</li>
      <li>Building strong relationships with healthcare professionals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At Northwest Oncology and Hematology, I managed medical records and coordinated with
      laboratory services for chemotherapy patients, developing strong skills in precise
      documentation and attention to detail. As a Certified Pharmacy Technician at Osco Pharmacy, I
      gained valuable experience in medication inventory management and quality control - skills
      that demonstrate my ability to maintain the high standards of accuracy required in laboratory
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it represents the perfect alignment of my
      career goals and educational aspirations. I am actively researching medical laboratory
      certification programs and professional development opportunities in laboratory science,
      making Mercyhealth’s educational assistance programs especially appealing. As a Harvard
      resident, I understand the vital role Mercyhealth plays in our area’s healthcare system, and I
      am eager to grow both professionally and academically while serving our local community. The
      part-time schedule would provide the ideal balance for pursuing further education while
      gaining hands-on laboratory experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experience, and educational goals
      can contribute to the success of your laboratory team. Thank you for considering my
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,<br />
      Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
