Take in Earnest Money and send emails to agents on both sides and will load it in DotLoop

I have a great positive attitude with empathy for agents and clients. I care
Overseen your office for the past 2.5 years. .
Past President of WCR and current member of the Chapter again. 
Broker License in Wisconsin 6 mos. 
Managing Brokers License in Illinois since 2012


What I would like to see
	•	Another office in Wisconsin or close to the border- we have a location on IL Rt 31 leading into Wisconsin that would be great. 
	•	An office is Wauconda and then Schaumburg
	•	Utilize the programs we have with BHGRE for our agents more including BHGRE Connect instead of FB
	•	Go out on more Broker Tours and Open houses
	•	Learn more about our agents since they are our clients too. 
	•	Build the office up as one team
	•	Allow walk-ins again. That can be a 50/50 split
	•	Referrals at a 70/30 split. (The sites that Realtors used to get their leads at before other companies took them over and started charging a fee) You would get more agents wanting to do the work. More agents on the sites will also give more leads, transactions, money in the office and agents pockets. 
	•	Building up our Company agents
	•	Waive fees for all new agents coming in their first 3 months while they are getting situated
	•	Help agents with onboarding and sending out post cards and help them load their CRM to something that they will use. 
	•	Move off Dotloop and onto the transaction management page through MRED (18 mos)
	•	Use commercial ads for our Company 
	•	Me to be the liaison for agents and help with one on one needs. 


I believe that I have grown over these last 2.5 years and my office is doing much better than the Grayslake office. Jim’s team is what is keeping the sales coming through in that office.  I spend a lot more of my time here than what has been expected of me. I want the offices to succeed and I want to be a part of that.
